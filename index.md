This is a very serious website dedicated to true facts. Originally purchased to prove a point about dot-orgs, this domain is now used to publish various projects of the editors. Currently underway is the [*Reasonable Socialist Viper Party* webcomic](#rsvp/index.md), some highly legitimate, scientific, and journalistic [research papers and news articles](#prose/index.md), and various engineering projects.

Explore the **Contents**. Some things are incomplete, others have substance. There is only one practical way to find out which, and those with substance might be interesting.
